            <h3>DAV PUBLIC SCHOOL</h3>
            <p>
                DAV Public School holds a special place in my heart, as it was where I spent my primary as well as secondary high school years<br>
                from nnursery to 12th class. The school's sprawling campus and expansive grounds provided the perfect <br>
                environment for learning and play. The campus was fun, It <br>
                was on whole building including a library, and a playground that seemed to stretch on forever.<br>
                I have fond memories of running around the playground with my friends, playing games and enjoying <br>
                the fresh air. Even though I have moved on to new chapters in my life, I often find myself reminiscing <br> 
                about my time at DAV Public School and missing the sense of community and belonging that it provided. <br>

         <p>
          I am currently studying Computer Engineering at VJTI has been an enriching experience filled with opportunities for <br>
          growth and learning. The college's vibrant atmosphere, coupled with its strong academic curriculum, has helped me develop both  <br>
          personally and professionally. Participating in fests, carnivals, and events like Traditional Day has been a highlight, allowing <br>
        me to showcase my talents, interact with peers, and immerse myself in the diverse culture of VJTI. I have been a part of the girls volleyball team. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time <br>
            here, and it has only strengthened my resolve to pursue a career as a front-end developer. The support from faculty and the  <br>
            exposure to practical knowledge have been instrumental in shaping my aspirations and fueling my passion for technology.  <br>
